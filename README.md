# Logistic Regression vs Bayes Classifier

## Project Overview
This project involves implementing various data science techniques to analyze a given dataset. The objective is to perform **data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation** to extract meaningful insights and optimize model performance.

The notebook includes:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key patterns, correlations, and distributions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables to enhance model performance.
- **Model Implementation**: Training and evaluating machine learning models, specifically **Logistic Regression** and **Bayes Classifier**.
- **Performance Metrics Analysis**: Comparing different models using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization**: Graphically analyzing model decision boundaries.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Evaluating classification performance through confusion matrices.
